          <p>Hi, {user.name}. You have just successfully logged in, and were forwarded here
            by <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> in <code>App.js</code>, which is listening to
            the auth reducer via redux <code>@connect</code>. How exciting!
          </p>

          <p>
            The same function will forward you to <code>/</code> should you chose to log out. The choice is yours...
